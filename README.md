Description

The notebook code for the practice exercises on pandas, numpy and matplotlib python modules.
In pandas, the read_csv method imports the Salaries.csv file into the notebook for analysis.
Other methods include make it possible to manipulate the resulting dataframe, query it and even
create new dataframe from the major one. The numpy section contains methods to create multi-dimensional
arrays, and complete common tasks associated with such arrays. Some methods allow mathematical
operations, such as exponentiation on the array, and others allow for extracting or slicing elements from 
the array. In the matplotlib section, the module is used to create visualizations based on different
sets of data. Seaborn is also handy in plotting data from dataframes.
